    <p><i>Simple, cheap, healthy and <b>so delicious.</i></b></p>

            <li>Salt and pepper <i>for seasoning</i></li>

        <h2><i>Steps</i></h2>

            <dt><b>Preparation</b></dt>
            <dd><i>Preparation for this dish is really simple. All we really need to do is to crush the garlic under a knife,
                removing the skin. 
            </i></dd>
            <dt><b>Cooking the pasta</b></dt>
            <dd><i>The pasta shells are very delicate to cooking and easily ruined if left boiling for too long or left to dry out.
                In order to stop sticking, the pasta shells need plenty of water, enough to dance around in, as well as ample salt to season.
                Rule of thumb is to boil the pasta for one/two minutes less than the stated cooking time on the packet. 
                This should ensure al dente pasta everytime which is important as the cooking will be finished off in the sauce.

        <ol>
            <li>In a large pan<small>see above</small> add plenty of <strong>cold</strong> water and season well with salt before bringing to the boil.
            <i>The water needs to be well salted in order to season the pasta. Unsalted water results in flavourless pasta!!</i></li>
            <li>Once the pasta water has boiled add in the pasta, cooking per instructed on the packet<small>see above</small>.</li>
            <li>In a nicely sized fry pan add a good dollop of olive oil, followed by the crushed garlic.
                Now we will turn the heat on to a medium low, infusing the garlic into the oil.
            </li>
            <li>Once the garlic becomes fragrant you may remove it and add in the can of tomatoes.
                Fill half the can with water from the tap, giving it a little swirl before adding it in with the tomatoes.
                Season with some salt and let cook down. 
            </li>
            <li>Once the tomato sauce has reached your desired consistency and taste (seasoning with salt and black pepper to taste) it's time
                to add the al dente pasta shells. Mix in the pasta shells with a ladelfull of pasta water<small>see note</small> and combine. 
            </li>
            <li>Once combined serve to a plate garnishing with plenty of grated cheese and a drizzle of <i>extra virgin olive oil</i>.</li>
        </ol>
        <p><i>If desired sprinkle a handful of chopped basil leaves over the top to add some extra contrast and flavour.</i></p>
        <dl>
            <dt><b><i>Notes</i></b></dt>
            <dd>Adding some of the starchy pasta water into the sauce when combining helps really elevate the dish.
                It works as both seasoning and the starch really brings the sauce together.

        <p  class="bg-colour font">Now, online I hear you all dissin' British food. <i class="bg-colour">It's bland, boring, where's the seasoning?? lol...</i>
        But come on man, British food is some of the best. It may not be as exciting as a spicy curry or iconic as the simple tomato pasta,
    but trust me, it has it's place.</p>
    <p  class="bg-colour font">British food is simple. It's for the working man. It goes with a nice mug of strong tea and keeps you going. It's heartwarming and feels like
        a nice hug on a rainy day. You might all laugh at us, but it's what keeps us going through the day.</p>
    <p  class="bg-colour font">The biggest hug on a plate for me has to be beans on toast. It's perfect for any meal, any time of the day. If you can get ahold of a nice can of 
        Heinz <i class="bg-colour">(beans means Heinz)</i> or Branston beans definitely give it a try.</p>
        <p  class="bg-colour font">This is my favourite arrangement of the <i class="bg-colour">Best of British</i>, beans on toast.</p>
        <h2 class="bg-colour"><i class="bg-colour">Ingredients</i></h2>
        <ul class="bg-colour">
            <li  class="bg-colour font">A can of baked beans</li>
            <li  class="bg-colour font">Brown bread (the more seeds and that the better)</li>
            <li  class="bg-colour font">Salted butter</li>
            <li  class="bg-colour font">Strong mature chedder cheese</li>
            <li  class="bg-colour font">Marmite</li>
            <li  class="bg-colour font">Black pepper to season</li>
        </ul>
        <h2 class="bg-colour"><i class="bg-colour">Steps</i></h2>
        <ol class="bg-colour">
            <li  class="bg-colour font">Get the tin of beans in a pan and start heating on a low to medium heat.</li>
            <li  class="bg-colour font">Bread in the toaster ticking away</li>
            <li  class="bg-colour font">Once the toast has popped spread a generous amount of your favourite salted butter. Make sure to reach all the corners and edges of the toast.</li>
            <li  class="bg-colour font">Spread a nice layer of marmite over top of the butter. I like a nice layer but put as little or as much as you like.</li>
            <li  class="bg-colour font">Layer thin slices of the chedder on both slices of toast.</li>
            <li  class="bg-colour font">Pour the beans all over the top, season with some black pepper and enjoy.</li>
        </ol>

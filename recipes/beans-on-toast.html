        <h2><i>Description</i></h2>
        <p>Now, online I hear you all dissin' British food. <i>It's bland, boring, where's the seasoning?? lol...</i>
        But come on man, British food is some of the best. It may not be as exciting as a spicy curry or iconic as the simple tomato pasta,
    but trust me, it has it's place.</p>
    <p>British food is simple. It's for the working man. It goes with a nice mug of strong tea and keeps you going. It's heartwarming and feels like
        a nice hug on a rainy day. You might all laugh at us, but it's what keeps us going through the day.</p>
    <p>The biggest hug on a plate for me has to be beans on toast. It's perfect for any meal, any time of the day. If you can get ahold of a nice can of 
        Heinz <i>(beans means Heinz)</i> or Branston beans definitely give it a try.</p>
        <p>This is my favourite arrangement of the <i>Best of British</i>, beans on toast.</p>
        <h2><i>Ingredients</i></h2>
        <ul>
            <li>A can of baked beans</li>
            <li>Brown bread (the more seeds and that the better)</li>
            <li>Salted butter</li>
            <li>Strong mature chedder cheese</li>
            <li>Marmite</li>
            <li>Black pepper to season</li>
        </ul>
        <h2><i>Steps</i></h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Get the tin of beans in a pan and start heating on a low to medium heat.</li>
            <li>Bread in the toaster ticking away</li>
            <li>Once the toast has popped spread a generous amount of your favourite salted butter. Make sure to reach all the corners and edges of the toast.</li>
            <li>Spread a nice layer of marmite over top of the butter. I like a nice layer but put as little or as much as you like.</li>
            <li>Layer thin slices of the chedder on both slices of toast.</li>
            <li>Pour the beans all over the top, season with some black pepper and enjoy.</li>
        </ol>

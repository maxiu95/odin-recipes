        <h2><i>Description</i></h2>
        <p><strong>I love curry.</strong> If asked I'd probably say it's my favourite food. I literally could eat it day in, day out without getting the slightest bit bored.
        Its chuck full of delicious and fragrant spices and goes well with bread or rice.</p>
        <p>This is an Indian inspired chicken curry recipe. Spices may seem scary and complicated to cook with at first but it's really very simple to make a delicious curry that leaves you and your dinner guests wanting more.
            The spices listed are of my own preference but feel free to add and experiment with whatever spices you like. The result will be delicious, I promise!
        </p>
        <h2><i>Ingredients</i></h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Chicken (on the bone, breast, thigh- whatever you like)</li>
            <li>Garlic and ginger paste</li>
            <li>spices (I like cumin, corriander, turmeric, a dash of cinnamon, paprika, red chilli powder, garam-masala)</li>
            <li>Salt and black pepper</li>
            <li>Onion</li>
            <li>Medium/large tomato</li>
            <li>Butter</li>
        </ul>
        <h2><i>Steps</i></h2>

            <dd><i>Thinly slice the onion and then tomato into small chunks. 
                I like to prepare the spices in a small plate or bowl 
                (a tablespoon to teaspoon each- whatever feels right for you).
                I'd also add salt (as much as your health can handle) and pepper in with the spices.
                If you opted for chicken on the bone leave as is, or else cut into bearable chunks.

        <ol>
            <li>Genorously add oil and a nice knob of butter into the pan<small>check note</small> and switch on a medium heat.</li>
            <li>Add the thinly sliced onions, frying for at least five minutes. <i>The onions need to be cooked well for a delicious curry.</i></li>
            <li>After cooking the onions well add the chicken to the pan and fry until brown.</li>
            <li>Now is time to add the chunked tomato, again cooking for at least five minutes. <i>Tomatoes, like the onion appreciate you taking your time and being cooked well.</i></li>
            <li>Once the tomato has cooked through, add the garlic and ginger paste, heating until fragrant.</li>
            <li>Chuck in your spice mix. The tomato should become a paste like consistency. Heat through until fragrant,  
                <i>taking care not to burn the spices, or the curry will lose fragance and introduce bitterness.</i></li>
            <li>Once the spices have become fragrant, add water. <i>I generally go for about a cup, but feel free to adjust and add as much or as little as you like.</i></li>
            <li>Turn up to a boil before turning back down and keeping to a simmer. Keep simmering until the desired consistency.</li>
            <li>At this stage feel free to add some more butter and garam-masala, mixing through before serving.</li>
        </ol>

            <dd>A regular fry pan will work but I prefer a wide flat pan with lots of space.</dd>

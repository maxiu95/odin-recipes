BEFORE;
    This is going to be my first project with the Odin Project. At first it will be a barebones HTML webpage but later it will be decorated with CSS (and maybe JavaScript?? who knows). I'm excited to get going and actually start building something- even if it is just with simple HTML. Should be fun... lets GO!!

CSS;
    First after completing the foundations of CSS I added some colour and font but it was all a bit messy and hard to read. Though, it looked ok and I left it as complete.

CSS 2;
    Next was learning the box system: margins, padding, borders etc. Going back to that CSS file after a while it was really hard to read and I hated looking at it. After some more playing around I decided to trash it and start again. Which I did, adding some padding, margins and borders to each aspect, organising it in a way slightly closer to how I had imagined before. The CSS file (now complete with a few more comments) is easier to read and make sense of. A lot of the fidly workings i moved to the html file, adding more classes to elements (although a bit teduous). I think I prefer it this way.
